Secure file upload/download portal with AES encryption using Flask.

Flask AES File Portal

A simple file upload/download portal built with Flask and AES encryption using PyCryptodome.
This project secures files both at rest (on disk) and in transit (via HTTPS if deployed with TLS).

ðŸ”§ Features

Upload files securely via web form or curl/Postman

Files encrypted with AES (CBC mode) before storage

Download & automatic decryption of files

Works locally or can be deployed on any server

âš¡ Installation & Setup

Clone repo

git clone https://github.com/dannyckhub/flask-aes-portal.git
cd flask-aes-portal


Create virtual environment

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
source venv/bin/activate # On Linux/Mac


Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the app

python app.py


Visit in browser:
ðŸ‘‰ http://127.0.0.1:5000

ðŸ“¤ Upload Example (via curl)
curl -X POST -F "file=@example.txt" http://127.0.0.1:5000/upload

ðŸ“¥ Download Example
curl -O http://127.0.0.1:5000/download/example.txt

ðŸ”’ Security Notes

AES key is generated once per session in this demo.

For production:

Use a persistent key (stored securely, e.g., in an environment variable).

Deploy with HTTPS (TLS) to secure data in transit.

Add authentication before allowing uploads/downloads.
